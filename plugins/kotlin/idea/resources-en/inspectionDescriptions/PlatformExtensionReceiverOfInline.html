Reports potentially unsafe calls of inline functions with flexible nullable (platform type with unknown nullability) extension receivers.
In Kotlin 1.0 or 1.1, such calls do not include nullability check in bytecode,
but in Kotlin 1.2, nullability check is included and can provoke <code>NullPointerException</code> if actual receiver is <code>null</code>.
It's recommended to add explicit <code>!!</code> if exception is what you want,
or consider changing the function's receiver type to nullable if it should work without exceptions.
<p>After the quick-fix is applied: explicit <code>!!</code> is added to receiver.</p>

<p>This inspection only reports if the Kotlin language level of the project or module is lower than 1.2.</p>
